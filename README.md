## ✨ Why ClawDeckX?

### macOS-Grade Visual Experience

The interface faithfully recreates the macOS design language — refined glassmorphism, rounded cards, and smooth animation transitions. Managing AI agents feels as natural as using a native desktop app.

### Beginner-Friendly Setup

Guided wizards and pre-built templates let you complete OpenClaw's initial configuration and model setup without memorizing a single command.

### Deep Configuration

Fine-tune every OpenClaw parameter — model switching, memory management, plugin loading, channel routing — all through a beautiful visual editor.

### Real-Time Observability

Built-in monitoring dashboard with live execution status, resource consumption, and task history — full visibility into every agent's behavior.

### Cross-Platform

Single binary, zero dependencies. Runs natively on Windows, macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), and Linux (amd64 & arm64). Download and run — that's it.

### Responsive & Mobile-Ready

Fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly from large desktop monitors to tablets and mobile phones. Manage your AI agents on the go — no compromise on functionality.

### Multilingual Support

Full i18n architecture with 13 built-in languages. Adding a new language requires only a translated JSON folder and a two-line code change.

### Local & Remote Gateway

Seamlessly manage both local and remote OpenClaw gateways. Switch between gateway profiles with one click — perfect for multi-environment setups like dev, staging, and production.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Deployment Options

Choose the deployment method that best fits your needs:

#### 1️⃣ Local Deployment (Recommended)

Install ClawDeckX on the same server as OpenClaw for full feature access and direct command execution.

**✅ Advantages:**
- Full feature support including direct OpenClaw command execution
- Lower latency and faster response times
- No network dependency between ClawDeckX and OpenClaw

#### 2️⃣ Remote Gateway

Install ClawDeckX on your local machine and connect to remote OpenClaw instances via WebSocket.

**⚠️ Limitations:**
- Some features requiring direct OpenClaw command execution are unavailable
- Depends on stable network connection between ClawDeckX and OpenClaw Gateway
- Slightly higher latency for operations

---

### One-Click Install & Maintain

The unified installer detects existing installations and lets you **install, update, manage, or uninstall** both Binary and Docker deployments from a single adaptive menu.

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClawDeckX/ClawDeckX/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClawDeckX/ClawDeckX/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Manual Binary Download

Download the binary from [Releases](https://github.com/ClawDeckX/ClawDeckX/releases). No dependencies. Just run.

```bash
# Run with default settings (localhost:18800)
./ClawDeckX

# Specify port and bind address
./ClawDeckX --port 18800 --bind 0.0.0.0

# Create initial admin user on first run
./ClawDeckX --user admin --pass your_password

# All options combined
./ClawDeckX --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 18800 --user admin --pass your_password
```

| Flag | Short | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `--port` | `-p` | Server port (default: `18800`) |
| `--bind` | `-b` | Bind address (default: `127.0.0.1`) |
| `--user` | `-u` | Initial admin username (first run only) |
| `--pass` | | Initial admin password (min 6 chars) |
| `--debug` | | Enable debug logging |

### CLI Commands

| Command | Usage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `reset-password` | `ClawDeckX reset-password <user> <pass>` | Reset a user's password |
| `reset-username` | `ClawDeckX reset-username <old> <new>` | Change a user's username |
| `list-users` | `ClawDeckX list-users` | List all registered users |
| `unlock` | `ClawDeckX unlock <user>` | Unlock a locked user account |

> [!TIP]
> **Forgot your credentials?** Run `ClawDeckX list-users` to find your username, then `ClawDeckX reset-password <username> <new_password>` to reset your password.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Security Reminder:** On first run, if no `--user` and `--pass` are provided, the auto-generated admin credentials will be printed to the console. Please change your username and password in the settings page immediately after logging in.

<br>

### Docker Install

> **Recommended:** Use the [one-click installer](#one-click-install--maintain) above — choose **Docker** when prompted. It handles download, port configuration, mirror detection, and shows credentials automatically.

**Manual method:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClawDeckX/ClawDeckX/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

After updating the image, recreate the container to apply Dockerfile and entrypoint changes:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:18800`. The first run will auto-generate an admin account — credentials will be shown in the container logs.

ClawDeckX and OpenClaw run in the same container. OpenClaw is **preinstalled** in the official Docker image with version-pinned compatibility. On startup, the container entrypoint auto-starts the OpenClaw Gateway if a configuration file exists. If OpenClaw is not yet configured, complete the Setup Wizard in the web UI — no manual installation is needed.

The official Docker image also preinstalls common skill/runtime dependencies including `go`, `python3`, `uv`, `ffmpeg`, `jq`, `ripgrep`, `wget`, and `make`, so many OpenClaw skills can run out of the box without extra system package installation.

By default, the bundled ClawDeckX service connects to the local in-container Gateway at `127.0.0.1:18789`. If you need to use a host or external Gateway instead, override `OCD_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_HOST` and `OCD_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` in `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
# View credentials
docker logs clawdeckx
```

#### Docker Configuration

**Ports:**

| Port | Service | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `18800` | ClawDeckX Web UI | Main dashboard (mapped by default) |
| `18789` | OpenClaw Gateway | Optional: expose for external debugging |

To expose the Gateway port, add `- "18789:18789"` under `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.

Note that exposing `18789` alone does not guarantee host access to the Gateway. The generated minimal OpenClaw config binds the Gateway to `loopback` by default, so you may also need to adjust the Gateway bind setting for external access.

**Environment Variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `OPENCLAW_HOME` | `/data/openclaw/home` | OpenClaw home root override |
| `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` | `/data/openclaw/state` | OpenClaw state directory |
| `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` | `/data/openclaw/state/openclaw.json` | OpenClaw config file path |
| `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX` | `/data/openclaw/npm` | Persistent npm prefix for user-installed upgrades |
| `OCD_DB_SQLITE_PATH` | `/data/clawdeckx/ClawDeckX.db` | ClawDeckX SQLite database path |
| `OCD_LOG_FILE` | `/data/clawdeckx/ClawDeckX.log` | ClawDeckX server log path |
| `OCD_GATEWAY_LOG` | `/data/openclaw/logs/gateway.log` | Persistent OpenClaw Gateway log |
| `OCD_SETUP_INSTALL_LOG` | `/data/openclaw/logs/install.log` | Setup/install log path |
| `OCD_SETUP_DOCTOR_LOG` | `/data/openclaw/logs/doctor.log` | Doctor/diagnostic log path |
| `OCD_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Gateway host address |
| `OCD_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` | `18789` | Gateway port |
| `OCD_OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | *(empty)* | Gateway auth token |
| `OCD_PORT` | `18800` | ClawDeckX listen port |
| `OCD_BIND` | `0.0.0.0` | ClawDeckX bind address |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Container timezone (e.g. `Asia/Shanghai`) |

**Preinstalled Runtime Tools:**

- **`go`**
- **`python3`**
- **`uv`**
- **`ffmpeg`**
- **`jq`**
- **`ripgrep`**
- **`wget`**
- **`make`**

> [!NOTE]
> The Docker image is larger than a minimal runtime because it includes the full runtime toolchain for OpenClaw skills. This ensures many skills can run out of the box without requiring you to install system packages inside the container.

**Volumes:**

| Volume | Mount Point | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `clawdeckx-data` | `/data/clawdeckx` | ClawDeckX database and app logs |
| `clawdeckx-openclaw-data` | `/data/openclaw` | OpenClaw config, state, logs, and user-installed upgrades |

> [!TIP]
> OpenClaw is bundled in the image and its configuration is persisted via Docker volumes. After `docker pull` and recreate, OpenClaw remains available and your configuration is preserved.

**Persistent Paths:**

| Path | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/data/openclaw/npm` | User-installed npm packages (upgrades) |
| `/data/openclaw/state` | OpenClaw state directory |
| `/data/openclaw/state/openclaw.json` | OpenClaw config file |
| `/data/openclaw/logs/gateway.log` | Gateway startup/runtime log |
| `/data/openclaw/logs/install.log` | Setup/install log |
| `/data/openclaw/logs/doctor.log` | Doctor/diagnostic log |
| `/data/openclaw/bootstrap/gateway-bootstrap.json` | Entrypoint bootstrap status |

OpenClaw is preinstalled in the Docker image. If it is not yet configured, ClawDeckX will guide you through the Setup Wizard to complete the initial configuration.

The container health check uses `/api/v1/health` for liveness. For diagnostics, you can call `/api/v1/health?detailed=true` to inspect ClawDeckX, OpenClaw, Gateway, and bootstrap state together.

**Resource Limits:**

The default `docker-compose.yml` sets memory limit to 2 GB and CPU limit to 2 cores. Adjust `deploy.resources.limits` as needed.
